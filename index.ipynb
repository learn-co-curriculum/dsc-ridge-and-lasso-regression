We've seen the simple linear regression using ordinary least squares, and its more general regression of polynomial functions. We've also seen how we can overfit models to data using polynomials and interactions. With all of that, we began to explore other tools to analyze this general problem of overfitting versus underfitting, all this using train and test splits, bias and variance, and cross validation.\n",
